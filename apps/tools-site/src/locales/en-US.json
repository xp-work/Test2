It was designed by the United States National Security Agency, and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard.The algorithm has been cryptographically broken but is still widely used.",

      "Description": "SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and first published in 2001. They are built using the Merkleâ€“DamgÃ¥rd construction, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Daviesâ€“Meyer structure from a specialized block cipher. The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with digests (hash values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits",

    "Description": "In cryptography, an HMAC (sometimes expanded as either keyed-hash message authentication code or hash-based message authentication code) is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key.
